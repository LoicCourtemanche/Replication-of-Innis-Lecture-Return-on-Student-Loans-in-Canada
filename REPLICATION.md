- [SUGGESTED] We suggest you update the openICPSR metadata fields marked as (suggested), in order to improve findability of your data and code supplement. 


## Data checks

> INSTRUCTIONS: When data are present, run checks:
> - can data be read (using software indicated by author)?
> - Are datasets in archive-ready formats (CSV, TXT) or in custom formats (DTA, SAS7BDAT, Rdata)? Note: Numbers and Mathematica data files are not considered archive-safe and cannot be accepted. 
> - Do the data files have variable labels (Stata: run `describe using (name of DTA)` and check that there is content in the column "variable label")?
> - Run check for PII ([PII_stata_scan.do](PII_stata_scan.do), sourced from [here](https://github.com/J-PAL/stata_PII_scan) if using Stata) and report results. Note: this check will have lots of false positives - fields it thinks might be sensitive that are not, in fact, sensitive. Apply judgement.


## Code description

- clean CSLP repayment.do: This program cleans the raw repayment file.
- clean CSLP disbursement.do: This program cleans the raw disbursement file.
- clean CSLP needs.do: This program cleans the raw needs assessment file.
- clean repay by cohort.do: This program further cleans the repayment file by last consolidation year.
- calc repay case3.do: This program calculates annual payments for inconsistent cases where payments were made prior to the last loan consolidation.
- calc repay other.do: This program calculates annual payments for all other cases.
- calc default.do: This program imputes payments after default.
- predict payments.do: This program runs Tobit regressions and imputes payments after the observed period for borrowers who do not have the full repayment history.
- calc return.do: This program calculates the realized return.
- return analysis.do: This program generates return statistics and runs return regressions.
- rank cslp.do: This program labels the institutions.
- robust sample.do: This program generates statistics for different samples (online appendix Table A1).
- create default data.do: This program reads data from the file “Repayment Post

## Missing Requirements

> INSTRUCTIONS: If the replication package contains Stata programs run `tools/Stata_scan_code/scan_packages.do`, ensuring that you update the global `codedir` first. If the data is accessible, add any packages not mentioned in the README to the `config.do` and paste the excel output as a table below. If the data is restricted-access and not obtainable in a reasonable amount of time, paste the excel output as a table below.

> INSTRUCTIONS: If it turns out that some requirements were not stated/ are incomplete (software, packages, operating system), please list the *missing* list of requirements here. Remove lines that are not necessary. If the stated requirements are complete, delete this entire section, including the [REQUIRED] tag at the end.

## Computing Environment of the Replicator


## Replication steps

> INSTRUCTIONS: provide details about your process of accessing the code and data.
> Do NOT detail things like "I save them on my Desktop".
> DO describe actions   that you did  as per instructions ("I added a config.do")
> DO describe any other actions you needed to do ("I had to make changes in multiple programs"), without going into detail (the commit log can provide that information)


## Findings

> INSTRUCTIONS: Describe your findings both positive and negative in some detail, for each **Data Preparation Code, Figure, Table, and any in-text numbers**. You can re-use the Excel file created under *Code Description*. When errors happen, be as precise as possible. For differences in figures, provide both a screenshot of what the manuscript contains, as well as the figure produced by the code you ran. For differences in numbers, provide both the number as reported in the manuscript, as well as the number replicated. If too many numbers, contact your supervisor.


### Data Preparation Code


### Tables


### Figures

> INSTRUCTIONS: Please provide a comparison with the paper when describing that figures look different. Use a screenshot for the paper, and the graph generated by the programs for the comparison. Reference the graph generated by the programs as a local file within the repository.


### In-Text Numbers

> INSTRUCTIONS: list page and line number of in-text numbers. If ambiguous, cite the surrounding text, i.e., "the rate fell to 52% of all jobs: verified".

[ ] There are no in-text numbers, or all in-text numbers stem from tables and figures.

[ ] There are in-text numbers, but they are not identified in the code


## Classification

- [ ] full reproduction
- [X] full reproduction with minor issues
- [ ] partial reproduction (see above)
- [ ] not able to reproduce most or all of the results (reasons see above)


### Reason for incomplete reproducibility

- [ ] `Discrepancy in output` (either figures or numbers in tables or text differ)
- [ ] `Bugs in code`  that  were fixable by the replicator (but should be fixed in the final deposit)
- [ ] `Code missing`, in particular if it  prevented the replicator from completing the reproducibility check
  - [ ] `Data preparation code missing` should be checked if the code missing seems to be data preparation code
- [ ] `Code not functional` is more severe than a simple bug: it  prevented the replicator from completing the reproducibility check
- [ ] `Software not available to replicator`  may happen for a variety of reasons, but in particular (a) when the software is commercial, and the replicator does not have access to a licensed copy, or (b) the software is open-source, but a specific version required to conduct the reproducibility check is not available.
- [ ] `Insufficient time available to replicator` is applicable when (a) running the code would take weeks or more (b) running the code might take less time if sufficient compute resources were to be brought to bear, but no such resources can be accessed in a timely fashion (c) the replication package is very complex, and following all (manual and scripted) steps would take too long.
- [ ] `Data missing` is marked when data *should* be available, but was erroneously not provided, or is not accessible via the procedures described in the replication package
- [ ] `Data not available` is marked when data requires additional access steps, for instance purchase or application procedure.
